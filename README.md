# Digital Alarm Clock Project

Group Members: Arwa Abdelkarim, Jana Elfeky, Kareem Elnaghy

Our team is currently focused on developing a digital alarm clock. We've begun by designing the Datapath and Control unit block diagrams as the foundation of our project. Using Logism Evolution, we've simulated the functionality of the clock's hour, minute, and second counters. Additionally, we've created an ASM (Algorithmic State Machine) chart to guide our software development. These steps are helping us progress steadily towards creating a functional and user-friendly digital alarm clock.
